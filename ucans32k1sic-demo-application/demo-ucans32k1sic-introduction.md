# Demo: UCANS32K1SIC Introduction

A sample application based on PX4/NuttX has been prepared that can be flashed to the UCANS32K1SIC boards. The basic premise is to form a two node CAN-FD network, and give you a console terminal available on each board using

 the UART/USB cable connected to your PC.

  
Simple commands can be issued on each node to initiate CAN-FD communications. 

The UCAN boards will be powered via 5V injected through he CAN-TERM board microUSB connection.
